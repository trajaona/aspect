# Configuration file to be used with clang-tidy

# This file is automatically discovered by clang-tidy when you run it on a
# file in a subdirectory.

# Usage:
#
# set DEAL_II_DIR to an installation made with clang
# rm -rf build; mkdir build; cd build
# CXX=clang++ CC=clang cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY="clang-tidy;-fix;-quiet;-header-filter=$(realpath ..)"  ..
# make -j 4

# enabled checks:
Checks: '-*,modernize-use-emplace,modernize-make-shared,mpi-*'


# other options to be used in the future as soon as we compile cleanly:

# performance-*,-performance-inefficient-string-concatenation
# modernize-avoid-bind
# modernize-make-unique,
# modernize-replace-autoptr,
# modernize-use-nullptr
