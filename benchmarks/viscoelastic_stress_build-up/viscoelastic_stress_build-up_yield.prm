# This parameter file modifies the benchmark viscoelastic_stress_build-up.prm
# to use the Viscoelastic Plastic material model and include a constant
# yield stress of 100 MPa. Without the imposed yield stress, the viscoelastic
# stress will build up to ~ 200 MPa. However, the imposed yield stress will
# truncate the viscoelastic stresses at the yield stress magnitude. 
# For additional information on the model setup and analytical solution,
# see viscoelastic_stress_build-up.prm, which is located in this folder.
#
# The results can be observed by viewing the compositional field values
# representing the horizontal (stress_xx) or vertical (stress_yy) components
# of the viscoelastic stress tensor. Significantly, the stress near the 
# model boundaries is incorrect due to the compositional field boundary
# conditions, which are based on the initial compositional values (e.g., zero).
# This leads to oscillations in the stress field near the boundaries, which
# decay towards a constant value in the model interior as the stresses build up to
# 100 MPa. While the yield stress caps the viscoelastic stress at 100 MPa, 
# oscillations at the boundaries arise due to the fixed compositional boundary
# conditions. As noted in viscoelastic_stress_build-up.prm, this particular model 
# setup would benefit from tracking viscoelastic stress with particles, which do not
# require defining compostional boundary conditions. Increasing the model resolution 
# (currently 2 km) will also help mitigate these artifacts.
