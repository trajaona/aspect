    /**
     * A material model that combines non-linear plasticity with a simple linear
     * viscoelastic material behavior. The model is incompressible. Note that
     * this material model is based heavily on and combines functionality from
     * the following material models: DiffusionDislocation, DruckerPrager,
     * ViscoPlastic and Viscoelastic.
     *
     * Viscous stress is limited by plastic deformation, which follows
     * a Drucker Prager yield criterion:
     *  $\sigma_y = C\cos(\phi) + P\sin(\phi)$  (2D)
     * or in 3D
     *  $\sigma_y = \frac{6C\cos(\phi) + 2P\sin(\phi)}{\sqrt(3)(3+\sin(\phi))}$
     * where
     *  $\sigma_y$ is the yield stress, $C$ is cohesion, $phi$ is the angle
     *  of internal friction and $P$ is pressure.
     * If the viscous stress ($2\eta{\varepsilon}_{ii})$) exceeds the yield
     * stress ($\sigma_{y}$), the viscosity is rescaled back to the yield
     * surface: $\eta_{y}=\sigma_{y}/(2{\varepsilon}_{ii})$
     * This form of plasticity is commonly used in geodynamic models.
     * See, for example, Thieulot, C. (2011), PEPI 188, pp. 47-68. "
     *
     * The viscoelastic rheology takes into account the elastic shear
     * strength (e.g., shear modulus), while the tensile and volumetric
     * strength (e.g., Young's and bulk modulus) are not considered. The model
     * is incompressible and allows specifying an arbitrary number of
     * compositional fields, where each field represents a different rock type
     * or component of the viscoelastic stress tensor. The symmetric stress tensor in
     * 2D and 3D, respectively, contains 3 or 6 components. The compositional fields
     * representing these components must be named and listed in a very specific
     * format, which is designed to minimize mislabeling stress tensor components
     * as distinct 'compositional rock types' (or vice versa). For 2D models,
     * the first three compositional fields must be labeled stress_xx, stress_yy
     * and stress_xy. In 3D, the first six compositional fields must be labeled
     * stress_xx, stress_yy, stress_zz, stress_xy, stress_xz, stress_yz.
     *
     * Combining this viscoelasticity implementation with non-linear viscous flow
     * and plasticity produces a constitutive relationship commonly referred to
     * as partial elastoviscoplastic (e.g., pEVP) in the geodynamics community.
     * While extensively discussed and applied within the geodynamics literature,
     * notable references include:

     *
     * The overview below directly follows Moresi et al. (2003) eqns. 23-32.
     * However, an important distinction between this material model and
     * the studies above is the use of compositional fields, rather than
     * tracers, to track individual components of the viscoelastic stress
     * tensor. The material model will be updated when an option to track
     * and calculate viscoelastic stresses with tracers is implemented.
     *
     * Moresi et al. (2003) begins (eqn. 23) by writing the deviatoric
     * rate of deformation ($\hat{D}$) as the sum of elastic
     * ($\hat{D_{e}}$) and viscous ($\hat{D_{v}}$) components:
     * $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}}$.
     * These terms further decompose into
     * $\hat{D_{v}} = \frac{\tau}{2\eta}$ and
     * $\hat{D_{e}} = \frac{\overset{\triangledown}{\tau}}{2\mu}$, where
     * $\tau$ is the viscous deviatoric stress, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity,
     * $\mu$ is the shear modulus and $\overset{\triangledown}{\tau}$ is the
     * Jaumann corotational stress rate. If plasticity is included the
     * deviatoric rate of deformation may be writted as:
     * $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}} + \hat{D_{p}$, where $\hat{D_{p}$
     * is the plastic component. As defined in the second paragraph, $\hat{D_{p}$
     * decomposes to $\frac{\tau_{y}}{2\eta_{y}}$, where $\tau_{y}$ is the yield
     * stress and $\eta_{y}$ is the viscosity rescaled to the yield surface.
     *
     * Above, the Jaumann corotational stress rate (eqn. 24) from the elastic
     * component contains the time derivative of the deviatoric stress ($\dot{\tau}$)
     * and terms that  account for material spin (e.g., rotation) due to advection:
     * $\overset{\triangledown}{\tau} = \dot{\tau} + {\tau}W -W\tau$.
     * Above, $W$ is the material spin tensor (eqn. 25):
     * $W_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} -
     * \frac{\partial V_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} \right )$.
     *
     * The Jaumann stress-rate can also be approximated using terms from the time
     * at the previous time step ($t$) and current time step ($t + \Delta t_^{e}$):
     * $\smash[t]{\overset{\triangledown}{\tau}}^{t + \Delta t^{e}} \approx
     * \frac{\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e} - \tau^{t}}}{\Delta t^{e}} -
     * W^{t}\tau^{t} + \tau^{t}W^{t}$.
     * In this material model, the size of the time step above ($\\Delta t^{e}$)
     * can be specified as the numerical time step size or an independent fixed time
     * step. If the latter case is selected, the user has an option to apply a
     * stress averaging scheme to account for the differences between the numerical
     * and fixed elastic time step (eqn. 32). If one selects to use a fixed elastic time
     * step throughout the model run, an equal numerical and elastic time step can be
     * achieved by using CFL and maximum time step values that restrict the numerical
     * time step to the fixed elastic time step.
     *
     * The formulation above allows rewriting the total rate of deformation (eqn. 29) as
     * $\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_{eff} \left (
     * 2\\hat{D}^{t + \\triangle t^{e}} + \\frac{\\tau^{t}}{\\mu \\Delta t^{e}} +
     * \\frac{W^{t}\\tau^{t} - \\tau^{t}W^{t}}{\\mu}  \\right )$.
     *
     * The effective viscosity (eqn. 28) is a function of the viscosity ($\eta$),
     * elastic time step size ($\Delta t^{e}$) and shear relaxation time
     * ($ \alpha = \frac{\eta}{\mu} $):
     * $\eta_{eff} = \eta \frac{\Delta t^{e}}{\Delta t^{e} + \alpha}$
     * The magnitude of the shear modulus thus controls how much the effective
     * viscosity is reduced relative to the initial viscosity.
     *
     * Elastic effects are introduced into the governing Stokes equations through
     * an elastic force term (eqn. 30) using stresses from the previous time step:
     * $F^{e,t} = -\frac{\eta_{eff}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \tau^{t}$.
     * This force term is added onto the right-hand side force vector in the
     * system of equations.
     *
     * The value of each compositional field representing distinct
     * rock types at a point is interpreted to be a volume fraction of that
     * rock type. If the sum of the compositional field volume fractions is
     * less than one, then the remainder of the volume is assumed to be
     * 'background material'.
     *
     * Several model parameters (densities, elastic shear moduli,
     * thermal expansivities, plasticity parameters, viscosity terms, etc) can
     * be defined per-compositional field. For each material parameter the
     * user supplies a comma delimited list of length N+1, where N is the
     * number of compositional fields. The additional field corresponds to
     * the value for background material. They should be ordered
     * ``background, composition1, composition2...''. However, the first 3 (2D)
     * or 6 (3D) composition fields correspond to components of the elastic
     * stress tensor and their material values will not contribute to the volume
     * fractions. If a single value is given, then all the compositional fields
     * are given that value. Other lengths of lists are not allowed. For a given
     * compositional field the material parameters are treated as constant,
     * except density, which varies linearly with temperature according to the
     * thermal expansivity.
     *
     * When more than one compositional field is present at a point, they are
     * averaged arithmetically. An exception is viscosity, which may be averaged
     * arithmetically, harmonically, geometrically, or by selecting the
     * viscosity of the composition with the greatest volume fraction.
