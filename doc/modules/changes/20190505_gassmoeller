Changed: The lateral averaging functions, e.g. used in the 'depth average'
postprocessor were optimized for some geometry models (spherical shell, box,
two merged boxes). Their lateral averaging is now slightly less accurate (the
difference is typically on the order of 1e-3 at the coarsest resolutions and
disappears with higher refinement), but they will be around 5 (2D) to 25 (3D)
times faster.
