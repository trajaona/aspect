Changed: The heat flux through the boundary cells that is computed
in several postprocessors is now computed using the consistent boundary
flux method as described in

Gresho, et al. (1987). The consistent Galerkin FEM for computing derived
boundary quantities in thermal and or fluids problems. International Journal
for Numerical Methods in Fluids, 7(4), 371-394.

This leads to significantly different (and more accurate) heat flux
output. In particular the following changes are expected:
  - Heat flux through reflecting boundaries is exactly 0,
  - Heat flux through boundaries with Neumann boundary conditions is
    computed correctly (previously ignored),
  - Heat flux through boundaries with Dirichlet boundary conditions is
    much more accurate than before,
  - Heat flux due to artificial stabilization terms is correctly included (fixing
    apparent heat flux imbalances for steady-state models in spherical geometry),
  - Heat flux now includes advective heat flux (i.e. the term velocity times
    temperature times density times specific heat capacity), not purely
    conductive heat flux.

Note that all of these changes purely affect the postprocessing. The
accuracy of the solution has not changed.

Benchmark and test results have been updated and therefore now differ from
publications that described their initial results.
