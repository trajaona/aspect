Fixed: The global entropy variation that is used in the artificial
viscosity computation was always computed with a quadrature of the 
polynomial degree of the temperature (even for compositional fields).
This is fixed now, and causes minor changes in the stabilization for
compositional fields if they use a different element order than the
temperature (usually not the case).
