New: There is now a new module structure for mesh deformation
plugins. The original free surface has become one of these plugins;
a function plugin is also available. The new structure enables the
user to prescribe movement of the mesh independent of the 
Stokes velocity by setting mesh velocity boundary conditions
on one or more mesh deformation boundaries. These boundary 
conditions are used to solve the Laplace problem for the velocity
of the internal mesh nodes, as was originally done for the free
surface alone.

Incompatibility: Due to the new mesh deformation module, there
is no backwards compatibility for input files that include a
free surface. The "Free surface" section has been moved into
the new "Mesh deformation" section. A free surface boundary can be
selected through "set Mesh deformation boundary indicators = top: free surface"
in the "Mesh deformation" section.
