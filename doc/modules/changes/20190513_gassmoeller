Changed: The entropy viscosity method for stabilizing the advection equations
for temperature and composition was substantially improved. A bugfix allowed to
reduce the stabilization parameters to the old defaults that were published in
the Kronbichler et al 2012 article. Additionally, boundary layers that are
conduction dominated are not longer unnecessarily stabilized, which results in
a more accurate heat flux, a better overall heat-flux balance, and closer
agreement with existing benchmark cases. The old implementation was not wrong,
but it required an unnecessarily high resolution to correctly resolve boundary
layers. The 'artificial viscosity' postprocessor can always be used to check
the amount of applied artificial diffusion.
