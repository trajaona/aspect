New: There is now an option to output visualization data as higher order
polynomials. This is an improvement in accuracy and requires less disk space
than the 'Interpolate output' option that was available before (the new option
requires the old option to be set, which it is by default). However the new
output can only be read by ParaView version 5.5 and newer and is therefore
disabled by default.
