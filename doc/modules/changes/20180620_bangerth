Changed: We now only set time step number and timestep sizes after
initialization is finished. 

Right now, there is no way to find out, for example in the hook that
is called from the function that builds constraints, whether we
are already in the process of time stepping, or only in the
initialization phase. So move the initialization of the time
step number and time step variables to the very end of the
initialization phase. Before this, these variables have invalid
values.
