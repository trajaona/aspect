New: Compositional fields can now be prescribed to a value that is 
computed in the material model as an additional output at every time 
step and then interpolated and copied into the solution vector (as 
opposed to advecting the compositional field). This option can be 
used by selecting the 'prescribed field' compositional field method 
in the input file.
