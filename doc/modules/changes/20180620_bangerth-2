Incompatibility: When selecting the 'dynamic core' plugin for the
boundary temperature, the plugin previously used the "Dynamic core"
spelling with a leading upper-case letter. However, all other plugins
use leading lower-case letters. Consequently, the plugin was changed
to follow the usual convention using all lower-case letters, even
though this is a change that requires changes to users' input files.
