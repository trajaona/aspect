New: Added a "rigid shear" benchmark that is based on an analytical
solution of the Stokes equations, and can be used to measure the influence
of different advection methods (particles, fields) on the Stokes
solution. The benchmark is described in the submitted manuscript: Gassmoeller,
Lokavarapu, Bangerth, Puckett. "Evaluating the Accuracy of Hybrid Finite
Element/Particle-In-Cell Methods for Modeling Incompressible Stokes Flow".
