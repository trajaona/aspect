Fixed: The nullspace removal had a minor bug that caused a small
remaining rotation in three dimensional models even if the net rotation
or angular momentum should have been removed. The bug was fixed, and
a new postprocessor called 'rotation statistics' was added that can be
used to calculate net rotation and angular momentum.
