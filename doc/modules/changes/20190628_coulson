New: There is a new material model plug-in that sets viscosity to  
a specified constant above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary,
which is specified by an ascii file or a maximum lithosphere depth 
value. Below this the viscosity is taken from any other available
material model. All other material properties are taken from the
base model.
