Fixed: There was a bug in the heating model manager that occurred when a 
simulation used several heating models and some of them filled the rates 
of temperature change heating model outputs, but others did not. Because 
many heating models do not touch the rates of temperature change heating 
model outputs at all, the values need to be reset to zero before those 
heating models are evaluated, otherwise they will contain rates of 
temperature change outputs from a heating model that was evaluated 
previously (which would lead to unintended temperature changes). This is 
fixed now by resetting the appropriate outputs to zero between the
evaluation of the different heating models.
