New: ASPECT can now call PerpleX to calculate material properties, phase
amounts and compositions on-the-fly. A simple material model (PerpleX lookup)
is provided which uses PerpleX to provide densities, compressibilities,
thermal expansivities and heat capacities on a cell-by-cell basis. This
model is provided as a proof-of-concept; more efficient procedures
will be required for production runs.
