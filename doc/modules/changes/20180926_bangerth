Improved: The artificial diffusion term that is added in the entropy viscosity
method to the temperature and composition equations is now computed as the
maximum of the physical diffusion and entropy viscosity instead of the sum.
This is reasonable, as the entropy viscosity is the smallest diffusion that is
necessary to stabilize the equation, and the presence of physical diffusion
stabilizes the equation exactly as an artificial diffusion would. This change
likely changes all benchmark results, but leads to more accurate, less
diffusive solutions. We verified the new method in selected benchmarks, and
updated test results but did not rerun and update all of the contained
benchmark cases.
