New: There is now a new method for compositional fields that allows
to prescribe them to a value that is computed in the material model 
and then, in a second step, to diffuse them based on a length scale 
given as an input parameter. This option can be used by selecting the 
'prescribed field with diffusion' compositional field method in the 
input file, and allows it to smooth quantities that are computed in 
the material model.
