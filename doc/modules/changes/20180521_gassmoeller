Fixed: The 'compositional heating' heating plugin had a parameter
'Use compositional field for heat production averaging' that was used
inconsistently with its description. Its first entry did not correspond
to the background field, but to the first compositional field, and the
last value was ignored. This is fixed now, the first entry is used for
the background field, and all following values determine whether to include
the compositional fields.
