Fixed: In case of combining reference profile formulations of the equations
(ALA, Boussinesq) with discontinuous temperature elements the face terms
in the assembly were incorrectly assembled with the full, instead of the
reference density. The volume terms were correct. The result were temperature
overshoots and possible crashes if the face terms dominate and create densities
smaller than zero. This is fixed now, the face terms are now correctly computed
with the reference density.
