New: There is a new matrix-free Stokes solver which uses geometric multigrid for 
preconditioning in the A-block. Currently the new method can handle no slip BCs for velocity 
on any mesh, and free slip boundary conditions for a box. Free surface, melt transport, and 
compressible flow are not yet implemented.
