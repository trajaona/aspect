Fixed: Fixed a bug in the 'Steinberger' material model that caused ASPECT
to use wrong compressibilities when only a single compositional field, and
a single material data file were prescribed. The correct behavior would have
been to ignore the compositional field and use the data file as background
material, but instead the compositional field was interpreted as volume
fraction and multiplied with the compressibility calculated from the
data file. This is fixed now.
