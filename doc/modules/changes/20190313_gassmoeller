Changed: The default option of the 'Interpolate output' input parameter of the
'Visualization' postprocessor was changed to 'true'. This will by default
increase the output resolution compared to the resolution of the internal mesh
by a factor of 2 in each dimension. This counteracts the effect that
visualization programs usually interpolate linearly between neighboring
vertices, while ASPECT's solution usually consists of higher order polynomials.
The output now resembles the internal solution more closely at the cost of
additional disk space.
