New: ASPECT now includes initial temperature and initial
composition plugins that use ASCII data files to define
the initial temperature or composition at a series of
layer boundaries. The first one or two columns define a
structured grid of horizontal points (x, y or lat, lon),
and the third gives the vertical position (z or r) of
the layer at that point. The remaining column(s) provide
the temperature/composition of the layer boundary at that
point. The plugin first linearly interpolates values
on the surface of the layer boundary, and then either
linearly interpolates between layer boundaries or uses the
value obtained on the overlying layer boundary.
